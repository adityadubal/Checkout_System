At the local Farmerâ€™s Market Chai, Apple, Coffee, Milk and Oatmeal sold every week. This week, to celebrate one year anniversary few special offers are made. Following are the offers:
1. BOGO -- Buy-One-Get-One-Free Special on Coffee. (Unlimited)
2. APPL -- If you buy 3 or more bags of Apples, the price drops to $4.50.
3. CHMK -- Purchase a box of Chai and get milk free. (Limit 1)
4. APOM -- Purchase a bag of Oatmeal and get 50% off a bag of Apples
